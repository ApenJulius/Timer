# Timer
Modified version of someting i found online

My modification is mostly just changing it from dispaying "00" when inactive and "0" when active to displaying properly "00" at all times until full use.

I also just took the theory and some parts of the code i didnt bother writing myself, but the rest is written by me

this was all for getting used to tkinter so i didnt really care about plagiarism
